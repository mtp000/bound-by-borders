# Bound By Borders

Bound by Borders is simulation game in which the player is a citizen of a Latin American country trying to immigrate to the US, legally or otherwise. The objective is to arrive to the US with a visa that grants permanent residency and permission to work. The simulation acts as an educational tool to inform players of the dangers migrants face en route here and the complexity of navigating the US immgration system. 

## Future Features
- [ ] Flow 2 storyboard images for immersion
- [ ] Data Visualization of Feedback survey to gauge player's knowledge before and after playing simulation
